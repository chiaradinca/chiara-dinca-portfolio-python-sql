# Chiara D'Inc√† ‚Äì Beginner Python & SQL Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm starting my journey in programming with a focus on **Python** and **SQL**.

Here I share my mini projects, experiments, and exercises as I learn. This repository is a personal learning log and showcase of what I'm building along the way.

## Python Projects

### üîê `password_generator.py`
A simple command-line password generator that:
- Asks the user for a desired password length
- Generates a secure password with random letters, digits, and symbols
- Prevents password creation if the length is too short

Technologies used: `random`, `string`, `input()`, basic loops & conditionals  
File: [password_generator.py](https://github.com/chiaradinca/chiara-dinca-portfolio-python-sql/blob/main/password_generator.py)

### üêç¬†`snake_game.py`
A classic Snake game built with Python and Turtle graphics.
The player controls the snake using arrow keys, eats red "apples" to grow, and avoids crashing into walls or itself. When the game ends, a custom ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù message is displayed.

Features:

- Keyboard controls (arrow keys)
- Real-time movement with screen updates
- Collision detection (walls and self)
- Score tracking and display
- Fun restart logic and personalized end screen

Technologies used: `turtle`, `random`, `time`, `functions`, `loops`, `conditionals`, list management

## SQL Projects

- `sql_queries.sql`: Basic examples of SELECT, JOIN, and aggregation
- `library_db_design.md`: Simple database schema notes for a library management system

---

## Skills I'm learning
- Python: variables, functions, loops, lists, files, user input
- SQL: SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY
- Git & GitHub: version control and project publishing

## Work in Progress

I'm currently learning and will be updating this space regularly with:
- More Python mini-projects
- Realistic SQL exercises
- Notes and reflections on my journey into tech

Stay tuned!
