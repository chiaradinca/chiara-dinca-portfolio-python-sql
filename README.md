# Chiara D'Inc√† ‚Äì Beginner Python & SQL Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm starting my journey in programming with a focus on **Python** and **SQL**.

Here I share my mini projects, experiments, and exercises as I learn. This repository is a personal learning log and showcase of what I'm building along the way.

## Python Projects

### üîê `password_generator.py`
A simple command-line password generator that:
- Asks the user for a desired password length
- Generates a secure password with random letters, digits, and symbols
- Prevents password creation if the length is too short

Technologies used: `random`, `string`, `input()`, basic loops & conditionals  
File: [password_generator.py](./password_generator.py)

## SQL Projects

- `sql_queries.sql`: Basic examples of SELECT, JOIN, and aggregation
- `library_db_design.md`: Simple database schema notes for a library management system

---

## Skills I'm learning
- Python: variables, functions, loops, lists, files, user input
- SQL: SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY
- Git & GitHub: version control and project publishing

---

## Work in Progress

I'm currently learning and will be updating this space regularly with:
- More Python mini-projects
- Realistic SQL exercises
- Notes and reflections on my journey into tech

Stay tuned!
